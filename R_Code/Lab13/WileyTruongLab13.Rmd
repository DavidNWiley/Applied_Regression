### Reading in Data

```{r}

# Reading in data
dat = read.csv("/home/david/Documents/2019 Spring/Applied Regression/Labs_HW/Data_Sets/Appendices/data-table-B-15.csv", header = T)

fit = lm(MORT~., dat)

summary(fit)
```

### Plotting Normality of Residuals


```{r}
qqnorm(fit$residuals)
qqline(fit$residuals)
```

Looking at the plot, we can see there is some light-tailed distribution leading us to believe there may not be normality in the data.

### Plotting Residuals vs Fitted

```{r}
plot(fit)
```
From observing that graph of Res vs Fit, we see there is a double bow happening. There means there is non-linearity in the data. This could be corrected by applying an appropriate transformation to the regressor or the response variable or use a method of weight least squares.
